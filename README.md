# Template
Based on the EDGI Repo Guidelines at https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/overview/blob/master/repo_guidelines.md

This repo is a template for all EDGI templates. Replace this paragraph with a description of the repo.

# How to start contributing to this repo
* Instructions go here
* Developer setup (if relevant)
* Slack channel (if relevant)

**Suggestions for additional components of Readmes:**
* A "How to use" section if the repo's project is a tool or website
* A link to the [good-first-issue](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-issue+user%3Aedgi-govdata-archiving) label (this link across EDGI, or a specific link for the repo)
* Highlight "ready" label on issues to mean "this is an issue that is ready to work on and needs an owner"
* Additional badges at the top, such as code quality indicators
* "[All contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors#emoji-key)" listing, following these additional guidelines (example: [web-monitoring-db contributors list](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/web-monitoring-db#contributors)):
  - Compact representation without avatars (less visual noise; easier to focus on contributions)
  - Icons are links with title attributes (accessibility)
  - Alphabetical order by surname/name/username (to eliminate implied ranking)
  - Presence in the list (and the name used) is optional and up to the contributor (not everyone wants to be listed â€” we offer, but do not add unless someone explicitly says yes)

**When using this template, please look through all of the files to ensure they apply to the new repo.**
